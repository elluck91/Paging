Swapping and Paging
The purpose of this assignment is to explore the various memory management algorithms for swapping and paging. You will write a series of small simulation programs in Java, C, or C++ (your choice). As in Assignment #2, you will generate simulated Processes <Process Name, Process size in pages, arrival time, Service duration> using random number generator. You should not need to make any process management system calls.
