Group #1

Swapping and Paging
The purpose of this assignment is to explore the various memory management algorithms for swapping and paging. You will write a series of small simulation programs in Java, C, or C++ (your choice). As in Assignment #2, you will generate simulated Processes <Process Name, Process size in pages, arrival time, Service duration> using random number generator. You should not need to make any process management system calls.

The algo can be set in main.cpp by calling the set_algo(int algorithm) where 1 = FIFO, 2 = LRU, 3 = LFU, 4 = MFU, 5 = Random. Default is random (5).
